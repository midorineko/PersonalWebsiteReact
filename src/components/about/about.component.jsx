                        Over the years, my views on programming have remained the same. 
                        I still believe that programming is a beautiful overlap of analytics and art, 
                        yet I have grown as a person. I discovered my passion for mentorship, finding 
                        intrinsic rewards in helping other people reach their fullest potential. I strive 
                        to lead by example in both programming and my personal life. I actively contribute 
                        to global learning communities by creating open-source 3D models for home printing, 
                        moderating forums, and providing teachable content. My thirst for knowledge is 
                        stronger than ever before. Currently, I am seeking to expand into a new field that 
                        aligns with my values and supports team-wide development.

                        I love programming because it isn't about memorization, but being able to understand 
                        what to look for. With time I have built the knowledge needed to decipher search results 
                        and apply complex theory to my code. I have applied this philosophy to many projects 
                        ranging from personal to corporate applications at scale. It has allowed me to program 
                        in a variety of languages professionally including Ruby on Rails, Java, NodeJS, and 
                        ReactJS. The main program I built at Amazon was TopOff, a staffing application that 
                        provides headcount for more than 800 stores and produces over a billion dollars annually. 
                        My premier side project is a home LED system. Iâ€™ve been working on it for my entire 
                        career due to my passion for lighting and the lack of affordable options. Utilizing 
                        AWS Amplify, AppSync, GraphQL, DynamoDB, and NodeJS Lambda I am upgrading the application 
                        to modern standards. Currently, looking for work please reach out if you are in need 
                        of a tenacious engineer who is always thirsty to learn.
